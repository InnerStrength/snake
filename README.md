# Snake

I feel like rebuilding classic games is something all programmers did at one point in time in their developing career.

This was my go through at the game. It utilizes the Turtle module, and doesn't require any special python installs. Not the most impressive program in the world, however this is moreso for documenting my progress in Python. This was during my instruction on classes and first GUIs. I also made Pong. I'm sure that will be posted as well.
